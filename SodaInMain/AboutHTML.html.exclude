<p id="intro">Time is GOLD cause the FUTURE is here. As millennial programmers we would like to help our country, we want to innovate the high technology
 here in the Philippines to make the works of our Filipino people much easier and faster. We can help through our little ways. We started to help a small 
company in their inventory system, it is the Canteen of STI College Cebu. We made a website where the manager of the canteen can access it and do the computer-based
 inventory, where they will only input data through typing  instead of writing it down in a piece of paper.This makes the inventory less-time consuiming and easier.
It is also user-friendly and useful for busy people like them.
